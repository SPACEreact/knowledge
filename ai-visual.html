                <p class="desc">
                    Prompt engineering is not "writing descriptions." It's the skill of <strong>communicating intent to
                        a neural network</strong> using its native language — which is not human language. Effective
                    prompts are structured hierarchically: subject first, then context, then style modifiers, then
                    quality tokens. The critical insight: AI models don't understand meaning — they understand
                    statistical associations. "A sad woman" doesn't mean sadness to the model; it means the visual
                    patterns that co-occurred with "sad" in training data. This is why <strong>specific, concrete
                        descriptions</strong> outperform abstract emotional instructions.

                <p class="desc">
                    Latent space is the mathematical universe where AI images "live" before they become pixels. It's a
                    high-dimensional space where every possible image is a point. Similar images cluster together — all
                    "portraits" are in one region, all "landscapes" in another. When you prompt, you're navigating
                    through this space, selecting a region. Understanding latent space helps you understand <em>why</em>
                    certain prompts produce certain results, why small prompt changes can cause dramatic visual shifts
                    (crossing a boundary between clusters), and why some combinations produce incoherent results
                    (landing between clusters).

                <h3>Conditioning vs Randomness</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Every AI generation balances two forces: <strong>conditioning</strong> (following your prompt
                    closely) and <strong>randomness</strong> (the model's own statistical entropy). More conditioning →
                    more prompt adherence, less surprise. More randomness → more unexpected results, less control. The
                    sweet spot is where the model follows your intent but adds details you didn't explicitly request —
                    but details that feel right. This is controlled by CFG scale, seed, and sampling parameters. Pure
                    conditioning produces stiff, lifeless images. Pure randomness produces chaos. The art is calibrating
                    the balance.

                <h3>Sampling Steps Meaning</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    AI images are generated through iterative <strong>denoising</strong> — starting from pure noise and
                    progressively refining into an image. Each "step" is one iteration of refinement. More steps = more
                    refinement = more detail and coherence, but with diminishing returns. 20 steps is usually sufficient
                    for Stable Diffusion. 50 steps adds subtle refinement. 150 steps wastes time with minimal
                    improvement. The important concept: each step isn't adding detail — it's <em>resolving
                        ambiguity</em>. Early steps establish composition. Middle steps define objects. Late steps
                    refine textures.

                <h3>CFG Scale Explained</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) scale controls how aggressively the model follows your prompt vs how
                    much creative freedom it has. <strong>Low CFG (1–5)</strong> = dreamy, loose, creative, often
                    incoherent. The model interprets your prompt loosely. <strong>Medium CFG (7–12)</strong> = balanced.
                    The sweet spot for most work. <strong>High CFG (15–30)</strong> = rigid prompt adherence, often
                    over-saturated, over-sharpened, artifacts appear. The model forces your prompt at the expense of
                    coherence. The insight: higher CFG doesn't mean "better quality" — it means "more prompt obedience
                    at any cost."

                <h3>Overfitting in AI Images</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    When an AI model has seen too many examples of a specific thing, it memorizes rather than
                    generalizes. Overfitting produces images that look like copies of training data rather than original
                    creations. Signs: faces that look like specific celebrities when you didn't ask for them,
                    over-detailed textures that feel "stock photo-like," and compositions that look exactly like known
                    photographs. Understanding overfitting helps you avoid prompts that trigger memorized outputs and
                    instead push toward the model's generative (creative) zones.

                <p class="desc">
                    Prompt collapse happens when a prompt is so long or contradictory that the model can't resolve all
                    the instructions simultaneously. Instead of attempting everything, it <strong>ignores parts of the
                        prompt</strong>, typically the concepts mentioned later. The model has limited "attention" — it
                    can only focus on so many concurrent ideas. The solution: shorter, more focused prompts. Separate
                    complex ideas into multiple generations. Prioritize what matters most at the beginning of the
                    prompt. Quality > quantity in prompt writing.

                <h3>Model Bias in Visuals</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Every AI model carries the biases of its training data. If the training set contains mostly Western
                    photography, the model defaults to Western aesthetics — certain skin tones, lighting styles,
                    compositions, and subject matter. Model bias affects: default beauty standards (what "beautiful"
                    generates), cultural representations (how different ethnicities are rendered), stylistic defaults
                    (photorealistic Western photography as "quality"), and compositional habits (center-framed,
                    well-lit, technically "correct" images). Awareness of bias isn't just ethical — it's practical.
                    Understanding bias helps you push past defaults toward more unique, authentic output.

                <p class="desc">
                    Given the same prompt and same seed, a model produces the same image — that's
                    <strong>determinism</strong>. Change the seed, and you get a <strong>variation</strong>. This
                    interplay is crucial for workflows: use fixed seeds when you want to iterate on composition while
                    changing style tokens. Use random seeds when exploring possibilities. Batch generation with 10
                    different seeds gives you 10 variations of the same concept — your job is to curate, not create.
                    Understanding determinism lets you treat AI generation as a precision tool, not a slot machine.

                <h3>Why AI Images Look Artificial</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    AI images often feel "off" even when technically impressive. The reasons:<br>
                    <strong>Over-perfection</strong> — Real images have imperfections: grain, slight blur, uneven focus.
                    AI defaults to clinical sharpness everywhere.<br>
                    <strong>Lighting inconsistency</strong> — Multiple light sources that conflict, shadows falling in
                    wrong directions, ambient light that feels sourceless.<br>
                    <strong>Texture homogeneity</strong> — AI tends to apply the same level of detail everywhere. Real
                    images have focal hierarchies — sharp subjects, soft backgrounds.<br>
                    <strong>Compositional safety</strong> — AI defaults to centered, balanced, "correct" compositions.
                    Real photography breaks rules for emotional effect.<br>
                    <strong>Emotional emptiness</strong> — AI can render a face but cannot understand the internal state
                    that produces a genuine expression. The result feels like acting, not being.<br>
                    The fix: prompt for imperfection, specify focal planes, use cinematic lighting terms, and accept
                    that the best AI images look slightly "wrong" on purpose.

                <p class="desc">

                        subject</strong> = what the image is about. <strong>Secondary subject</strong> = supporting
                    elements. <strong>Context/environment</strong> = background and setting. <strong>Style
                        modifiers</strong> = how it looks. Putting style first ("cinematic dramatic lighting of a woman
                    standing in rain") makes the model prioritize "cinematic" over "woman." Putting subject first ("a
                    woman standing in rain, cinematic dramatic lighting") centers the person. Order isn't grammar — it's

                <p class="desc">
                    Many AI tools support prompt weighting — assigning numerical importance to different parts of a
                    prompt. In Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, the <code>::</code> syntax works like:
                    <code>woman::1.5 rain::0.8 cinematic::1.2</code>. Higher weight = more influence on the final image.
                    This gives precise control over the hierarchy of elements. Use it to ensure your primary subject
                    dominates, prevent style modifiers from overwhelming content, and balance competing visual concepts.
                    The warning: extreme weights (above 2.0) cause artifacts. Subtlety wins.

                    Standard negative prompt: "blurry, low quality, distorted, extra fingers, watermark." But strategic
                    negative prompts go deeper: "oversaturated" prevents candy-colored output. "Stock photo" pushes past
                    generic compositions. "Symmetrical" encourages natural asymmetry. "Perfect skin" allows realistic
                    texture. Build a library of negative prompt phrases that counteract AI's most common failures for

                <p class="desc">
                    <strong>Style anchoring</strong> means using descriptive terms that evoke a visual sensibility:
                    "warm tones, soft focus, golden hour, slightly desaturated." You're describing the <em>aesthetic
                        properties</em> you want. <strong>Style theft</strong> means using an artist's name as a
                    shortcut: "in the style of [artist]." The difference matters: anchoring is skill — you understand
                    what creates a look and describe it. Theft is lazy — you outsource your aesthetic decisions to the
                    model's memory of someone else's work. Learn to describe the style you want in technical terms, and
                    you'll have more control and more originality.

                    The counterintuitive truth: <strong>shorter prompts often produce better results</strong> than long,
                    detailed ones. Why? Fewer instructions means fewer conflicts. The model has more room to interpret
                    coherently. A prompt like "tired fisherman, dawn, documentary photography" gives the model creative
                    space while maintaining intent. A 200-word prompt trying to specify every detail leads to prompt
                    collapse, averaging, and confused outputs. The rule: describe the <em>essence</em> of what you want,
                    not the <em>inventory</em>. If you can say it in 10 words, don't use 50.

                    shot" creates distortion and drama. "Telephoto high angle" creates compression and surveillance
                    feeling. The filmmaking vocabulary you learned in camera angles directly translates to AI prompt

                    exaggerated depth. "Shot on 85mm lens" creates compressed, portrait-like images with subject
                    isolation. "Shot on 135mm" creates heavily compressed backgrounds with dreamy bokeh. You can even
                    reference specific lenses: "anamorphic lens flare," "vintage Helios 44-2 swirly bokeh." The model
                    won't perfectly simulate these, but it captures the statistical essence of the look.

                    Understanding actual photography DOF — how aperture, focal length, and distance interact — makes
                    your prompts more precise and your results more cinematic.

                    "Dramatic lighting" is vague. "Single hard key light from camera left, 45° above subject, no fill,
                    deep shadows on right side of face" is specific and produces consistent results. AI responds to:
                    <strong>direction</strong> (from left, from behind, from above), <strong>quality</strong> (hard,
                    soft, diffused), <strong>temperature</strong> (warm tungsten, cool daylight, mixed),
                    <strong>motivation</strong> (window light, neon, candlelight), and <strong>style</strong>
                    (Rembrandt, split lighting, silhouette). The more your lighting prompt reads like a
                    cinematographer's note, the more cinematic your output.

                <p class="desc">
                    AI defaults to "perfect" — which looks fake. For realism, prompt against perfection:<br>
                    <strong>Skin:</strong> "visible pores, subtle skin texture, minor imperfections, natural skin
                    variation" instead of smooth AI skin.<br>
                    <strong>Fabric:</strong> "slight wrinkles in the fabric, natural drape, visible weave texture"
                    instead of perfect CG cloth.<br>
                    <strong>Surfaces:</strong> "worn wood texture, fingerprint smudges on glass, concrete with weather
                    staining" instead of pristine materials.<br>
                    The principle: imperfection is realism. Human brains detect perfection as uncanny. Prompting for
                    controlled imperfection produces images that feel photographed rather than rendered.

                    instant before action, the aftermath of an event, the unresolved tension. Prompt for: "a woman
                    mid-step turning to look behind her" (what's behind her?). "An empty swing still moving" (who was
                    just here?). "A man holding an unopened letter, staring at the name" (what does it say?). The image

                    objects. The model interprets mood through color palette, lighting, composition, and subject
                    expression simultaneously. Mood prompts work because they activate entire clusters of associated
                    visual concepts at once — the model draws from thousands of images that carry that mood. The detail
                    follows the feeling, not the other way around.

                    images that feel <strong>quiet</strong>: "empty room, single shaft of light, dust particles,
                    silence." "A sleeping city street at 4am, no people, soft streetlight glow." Images with visual
                    silence give the viewer space to project their own emotions. They're the AI equivalent of "hold the
                    shot" — the image doesn't shout, it whispers. Most overprompted AI images are visually noisy. Visual
                    silence requires courage and restraint.

                    subject partially cropped by frame edge." Asymmetry implies dynamism, imperfection, and reality. It
                    makes images feel captured, not constructed. Real photographs are rarely perfectly centered — the
                    photographer composed in the moment, and that imperfection is what makes images feel human.

                    tendency toward geometric perfection and creates images that feel caught, not staged.<br>
                    <strong>Natural chaos:</strong> Real scenes have uncontrolled elements — wind-blown hair, scattered
                    papers, imperfect arrangements. Prompt: "messy desk, natural arrangement, not staged," "wind-caught

                <p class="desc">
                    Temporal consistency is the quality of maintaining <strong>visual coherence across frames</strong>.
                    In real video, objects maintain their appearance from frame to frame. In AI video, objects subtly
                    shift shape, texture, and color between frames — this creates a "breathing," morphing quality that
                    the human eye immediately reads as fake. Temporal consistency is the single biggest challenge in AI
                    video and the primary differentiator between consumer-grade and cinematic AI output. Models that
                    maintain character appearance, clothing detail, and environmental stability across frames produce
                    watchable footage.

                <p class="desc">
                    Each individual frame must be internally coherent — objects should have consistent geometry,
                    lighting should be directionally stable, and spatial relationships should make physical sense. AI
                    video often produces frames where individual elements look realistic but their relationship to each
                    other is physically impossible: shadows going in wrong directions, objects intersecting, scale
                    inconsistencies. Frame coherence is the building block of temporal consistency — if individual
                    frames don't make physical sense, the motion between them can't either.

                <p class="desc">
                    In real video, movement is continuous — an object moving left continues to move left until a force
                    interrupts. AI video struggles with this: objects change direction mid-motion, speed varies
                    randomly, and movements start and stop without physical motivation. Understanding this limitation
                    lets you design prompts that minimize the problem: prompt for simple, unidirectional movements
                    rather than complex multi-stage actions. "Camera slowly panning right across a landscape" is far
                    more achievable than "camera orbits around a person while zooming."

                    AI video cameras often move without reason — drifting, rotating, and shifting in ways that feel
                    arbitrary. In cinema, every camera movement has emotional motivation. Apply the same principle to AI
                    video prompts: specify <em>why</em> the camera moves, not just how. "Camera slowly pushes in as
                    tension builds" vs "camera moves forward." The motivation won't literally change the output, but
                    framing your prompt in motivational terms helps you choose the right movement for the right moment.

                    physics of real camera rigs. No handheld shake, no mechanical smoothness, just eerie floating.<br>
                    <strong>Morphing objects</strong> — Shapes that subtly change between frames, especially at edges
                    and in complex geometry.<br>
                    <strong>Cloth/hair swimming</strong> — Fabric and hair that move independently of physics, flowing
                    without wind or body movement.<br>
                    <strong>Temporal flickering</strong> — Textures and colors that pulse or shimmer between frames.<br>

                <h3>Why AI Motion Feels Fake</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    AI motion feels fake because it lacks <strong>physical consequence</strong>. In reality, every
                    movement has inertia, friction, weight, and reaction. A person turning their head causes their hair
                    to follow with delay, their body to shift weight, their clothes to rustle. AI generates the primary
                    movement but often misses the cascade of secondary effects. The result: movement that looks smooth
                    but feels empty — like watching a ghost that walks perfectly but leaves no footprints. The fix:
                    prompt for fewer movements, accept imperfection, and design scenes where the AI's limitations become
                    aesthetic choices (intentional stillness, slow cinema, locked-off compositions).

                    <strong>Locked camera (static shot)</strong> prompts are far more reliable in AI video than moving
                    camera prompts. A static shot with subtle subject motion produces dramatically better results than
                    complex camera movements. When AI doesn't need to generate camera motion, it can devote its
                    "attention" to maintaining temporal consistency. Start with locked cameras and add movement only
                    when the emotional purpose is clear. "Static shot of rain falling on a window, camera locked" >

                    The most cinematic AI video often has the <em>least</em> movement. Micro-movements — a slight
                    breath, blinking eyes, swaying curtains, flickering candlelight — create life without the complexity
                    that causes artifacts. Prompt: "barely perceptible camera drift," "subtle wind moving the subject's
                    hair," "still portrait with only eyes blinking." These micro-movements are achievable for current AI
                    and feel more cinematic than dramatic action because they suggest a living moment captured, not
                    performed.

                    Stillness is not the absence of motion — it's a <strong>deliberate choice</strong>. Prompt for
                    scenes where nothing is supposed to move: "a frozen landscape, only snowflakes drifting," "a
                    sleeping face, only the chest gently rising." Intentional stillness turns AI's limitation
                    (unreliable complex motion) into an aesthetic strength. Some of the most powerful cinema is built on
                    stillness — Ozu, Tarkovsky, Dreyer. Apply the same philosophy to AI: the more still your frame, the
                    more the viewer projects their own emotion into it.

                    tendency toward unnatural smoothness. Real movement has micro-hesitations, weight shifts, and
                    corrections that AI doesn't generate automatically. Adding terms like "handheld camera movement,"
                    "natural breathing motion," and "documentary-style" can push AI toward more physically honest

                    feels dramatically more alive. Prompt: "visible breathing, gentle chest movement, relaxed but
                    alive." Breathing also applies to the camera itself — a slight, rhythmic drift that mimics the
                    subtle instability of a handheld camera. This "camera breathing" separates cinematic handheld from

                    strengths (atmosphere, texture, subtle change) while avoiding its weaknesses (complex motion,

                    <strong>Holding the frame:</strong> AI's equivalent of the held shot in cinema. Prompt for a scene
                    that barely changes over several seconds. The lack of change IS the content — the viewer's attention
                    shifts from "what's happening" to "what am I feeling." This controlled patience is rare in AI work
                    and immediately stands out.

                    "caught off-guard, not posing," "looking away from camera, unaware of being observed." The goal is
                    documentary quality — humans existing rather than acting. "A woman reading, occasionally pushing
                    hair behind her ear, not looking at camera" feels more human than "a beautiful smiling woman looking

                <p class="desc">
                    Advanced AI video tools allow you to set different prompts at different points in the timeline. This
                    is <strong>keyframe prompting</strong> — telling the AI what the scene should look like at specific
                    moments, and letting it interpolate between them. The strategy: keep keyframes conceptually
                    connected. Frame 0: "calm ocean at dawn." Frame 48: "ocean becoming turbulent, clouds gathering."
                    The transition should be gradual and physically possible. Avoid dramatic concept changes between
                    keyframes — "calm ocean" to "burning forest" creates incoherent transitions.

                        tokens</strong> — specific descriptive terms that remain constant across all prompts. If your
                    character wears "a dark green wool coat," use those exact words in every prompt. The consistent
                    tokens act as anchors, pulling the model toward consistency. Change the verbs and context between
                    prompts, but keep subject descriptions identical. Anchor tokens = the words that should NOT change
                    between frames.

                    style/subject descriptions, reference images (img2img), and ControlNet/IP-Adapter for structural
                    consistency. The challenge of shot-to-shot consistency is the #1 reason AI video projects fail — a
                    character looks different in every shot, breaking narrative immersion.

                    values where possible, using reference images as anchors, applying consistent post-processing per
                    project (LUTs, color correction), and generating key frames first then filling in between. Accept
                    that some drift is inevitable — integrate it into your aesthetic rather than fighting it completely.

                    Maintaining a consistent character face across multiple generations is one of AI's hardest

                    consistent subject descriptions as anchor tokens. Generate multiple images and curate for
                    consistency. Accept slight variation and use editing/compositing to smooth differences. The
                    technology improves constantly, but the fundamental truth remains: the human brain is
                    extraordinarily sensitive to facial inconsistency. Even 5% variation in face shape between shots
                    reads as "a different person."

                        expressions</strong> rather than transitioning expressions. "A face holding back tears" (a
                    single complex expression) is more achievable than "a face transitioning from happy to sad" (which
                    requires precise temporal control). The emotional power of a static micro-expression — caught in the
                    moment — can be immense.

                    focusing at slightly different points, iris detail that looks painted rather than organic,
                    catchlights (reflected light in the eyes) that are inconsistent with the scene's lighting, and the
                    "dead eye" effect where eyes look technically correct but emotionally empty. Prompt for: "natural

                    backgrounds, and "too good" proportions. Combat it with: asymmetric features, natural skin texture
                    prompts, environmental context (a person IN a place, not composited against one), candid vs posed
                    positioning, and slightly imperfect lighting. The goal: the person should look like they existed in

                    use compound emotional descriptions like "quiet determination mixed with exhaustion" instead of
                    "determined." Use behavioral descriptions: "trying not to smile," "holding back tears." For neutral
                    expressions, specify: "neutral but not blank, inner tension visible in the jaw." The goal is faces
                    that make the viewer ask "what are they thinking?" rather than telling them.

                    Real human faces are asymmetric — one eye slightly higher, one eyebrow raised more, a slightly
                    crooked smile. AI defaults to symmetry, which reads as uncanny. Prompt for: "natural facial
                    asymmetry," "one side of face slightly more illuminated than the other," "candid expression with
                    natural imperfection." The asymmetry principle extends to bodies: natural weight distribution
                    (leaning slightly), imperfect posture, and non-uniform clothing drape. Perfection is the enemy of

                    direction, and quality of light all work as prompts. Avoid "natural lighting" as a generic term —
                    specify the exact character of the light. "Overcast sky diffused light, flat illumination, soft
                    shadows" produces dramatically different results from "direct midday sun, harsh shadows, high
                    contrast." Real cinematographers think in these terms — bring that precision to AI.

                    room, cool blue light on skin." "Neon sign reflecting on wet pavement, colored light on subject's
                    face." Practical light prompts produce more believable AI images because they give the model a
                    logical light source to base all illumination on — instead of the invisible, omnidirectional
                    lighting AI defaults to.

                    "Subject backlit by sunset, hair glowing, face in shadow." Creates drama, beauty, and separation
                    from background.<br>
                    <strong>Rim light:</strong> A thin line of light on the subject's edge/contour, separating them from
                    the background. "Subtle rim light on the right shoulder and cheek, dark background." Creates depth
                    and cinematic separation.<br>
                    Both are powerful in AI because they create strong visual contrast — a clear foreground/background
                    separation that AI understands well. They're also inherently cinematic, immediately elevating an

                    "underexposed, detail lost in shadows" — these imperfections are what real DP decisions look like.
                    Not every frame is perfectly exposed, and that's intentional.<br>
                    <strong>Sensor noise/grain:</strong> "film grain, ISO 3200 noise pattern," "subtle digital noise in
                    shadow areas." Noise adds texture, age, and an organic quality that sterile AI images lack. It also
                    smooths out AI artifacts by adding a uniform texture layer across the image.<br>

                    This is the highest form of visual storytelling — the same principles that make silent cinema
                    powerful. Design your AI scenes as if the viewer can't hear anything. If the image doesn't convey
                    the emotion on its own, no caption or voiceover will save it.

                    untouched" implies loss. The absence of the expected creates emotional resonance. Prompt for scenes

                <p class="desc">
                    <strong>Repetition with variation:</strong> Generate the same composition multiple times with subtle
                    changes — the same window at different times of day, the same chair with different occupants (or
                    empty). Repetition creates expectation; variation creates meaning. The viewer notices what changed
                    and asks why.<br>
                    <strong>Non-literal symbolism:</strong> AI images don't need to be literal. "A tree with one branch
                    broken, surrounded by healthy trees" doesn't need to be about trees. It's about isolation, damage,
                    and the contrast between individual suffering and collective thriving. Prompt for images that work
                    on two levels — the surface (what you see) and the subtext (what it means).

                <p class="desc">
                    Because they're generated without intention. The AI produces motion — but motion without purpose is
                    just pixels changing. The fix: every AI clip you generate should answer "what should the viewer
                    feel?" before you write the prompt. If you can't answer that question, you aren't ready to generate.

                <h3>Over-Stylization in AI Art</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    The most common AI sin: piling on style modifiers until the image is drowning in aesthetic. "Ultra
                    detailed, hyper realistic, volumetric lighting, cinematic, octane render, 8K, trending on
                    ArtStation" produces images that look technically impressive but feel soulless. Style without
                    purpose is decoration. Before adding any style modifier, ask: "Does this serve the emotional
                    intent?" If not, remove it.

                <h3>Hyperrealism Fatigue</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    When everything is hyper-realistic, nothing feels real. The brain detects the uncanny — it's "too
                    real," which paradoxically feels fake. Some of the most effective AI images embrace stylization,
                    grain, imperfection, and abstraction. The goal isn't "indistinguishable from a photograph" — it's
                    "emotionally convincing." These are different standards.

                <p class="desc">
                    Recognizable AI defaults that have become clichés: the orange-teal color grade, dramatic lens flare,
                    a person standing in a beam of light, epic mountain vistas with "perfect" golden hour, brooding
                    character in rain with backlight. These are the stock photos of AI — technically competent,
                    emotionally empty. Break free by prompting for unfamiliar compositions, unusual lighting, and
                    human-scale moments instead of epic ones.

                <p class="desc">
                    AI camera movement that would be physically impossible — floating through walls, drone shots at
                    microscopic scale, orbits that ignore gravity. These movements announce "this is AI" immediately.
                    Effective AI video uses physically possible camera work. Also: more motion ≠ more cinematic.
                    Restraint. Shot holds. Slight movements. The best AI video is often the one where almost nothing
                    happens — but what does happen feels inevitable.

                <h3>Overprompting Mistakes</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    The #1 mistake: writing prompts that try to describe everything. "A 35-year-old woman with brown
                    hair wearing a green dress standing in a kitchen with granite countertops and a window showing a
                    garden and she's holding a coffee cup and there's a cat on the table and morning light coming in and
                    she looks contemplative." This overloaded prompt forces the model to average all concepts, producing
                    a muddy compromise. The fix: <strong>distill to essence</strong>. "A woman alone with her coffee,
                    morning light, contemplative." Let the AI fill in the details from its own coherence. Your job is
                    intent, not inventory.

                <div class="comparison-annotation">
