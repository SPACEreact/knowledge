        <p style="color: var(--text-2); margin-bottom: 3rem; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8;">
            Editing is not "putting clips together." It is <strong>thought architecture</strong> — the construction
            of time, emotion, and meaning from fragments. A great editor makes every cut invisible
            and every hold intentional. The audience should never notice editing — only feel it.

            </div>

                <h3>Film Editing Theory</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Film editing theory is the study of how juxtaposing two images creates a <strong>third
                        meaning</strong> that exists in neither image alone. This is the Kuleshov Effect at its
                    foundation: the same face followed by a bowl of soup means "hunger." The same face followed by a
                    coffin means "grief." The audience constructs meaning in the gap between shots. This is why editing
                    is the most powerful, and most invisible, storytelling tool in cinema. The editor doesn't just
                    arrange shots — they construct the audience's inner experience.

                <h3>Continuity Editing</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    The dominant editing style in narrative cinema. Continuity editing creates the illusion of
                    <strong>seamless, continuous action</strong> across multiple shots. Key principles include:
                    maintaining screen direction (the 180° rule), cutting on action (editing when a character moves so
                    the brain doesn't register the cut), eyeline matching (characters look in consistent directions
                    across cuts), and establishing-then-detailing (wide shot first, then close-ups). These rules are so
                    deeply embedded in audience literacy that breaking them feels jarring — which is occasionally the
                    point.

                <h3>Match Cut</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    A match cut transitions between two shots by linking them through a visual, thematic, or auditory
                    similarity. The most famous: in <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, a bone thrown into the air
                    match-cuts to a space station — millions of years of evolution in a single edit. Match cuts create
                    <strong>meaningful connections</strong> between seemingly unrelated images. They can link past and
                    present, internal and external, micro and macro. A match cut says: "These two things are the same
                    truth."

                <h3>Jump Cut Intention</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    A jump cut violates continuity — the camera stays in roughly the same position, but time skips
                    forward. In classical cinema, this was a mistake. Godard made it a deliberate statement in
                    <em>Breathless</em> — the jump cuts feel restless, modern, alive. Jump cuts communicate:
                    <strong>time compression</strong> (we don't need to see every moment), <strong>anxiety or
                        instability</strong> (the world won't hold still), or <strong>raw honesty</strong> (this isn't
                    polished, it's real). The intent behind the jump cut transforms it from error to expression.

                <h3>J Cut and L Cut</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    <strong>J Cut</strong> — The audio from the <em>next</em> scene begins before the visual cut. Named
                    because on a timeline, the audio extends backward like the letter J. Effect: the audience hears the
                    next environment before they see it, creating anticipation and smooth transitions. A phone ringing
                    in the next scene is heard over the current scene — your brain is already moving forward before the
                    image catches up.<br><br>
                    <strong>L Cut</strong> — The audio from the <em>current</em> scene continues after the visual has
                    cut to the next. Named because the audio extends forward like the letter L. Effect: emotional
                    carryover. A character's voice continues over a shot of the aftermath. The words linger even though
                    we've moved on visually.<br><br>
                    Together, J and L cuts are the foundation of <strong>invisible editing</strong> — the audience
                    experiences seamless flow because picture and sound are never locked together rigidly. Nearly every
                    conversation scene in a well-edited film uses these constantly. They're so ubiquitous that you've
                    never noticed them — and that's the point.

        <!-- C. PACING & RHYTHM -->

                <span class="letter">C</span>
                <h2>Pacing & Rhythm</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Editing is music without sound. Every cut is a beat. Every hold is a rest.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Pacing vs Rhythm</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    <strong>Pacing</strong> is speed — how fast the story moves forward. Fast pacing (quick cuts, rapid
                    information delivery) vs slow pacing (long takes, leisurely exposition).<br>
                    <strong>Rhythm</strong> is pattern — the recurring intervals of tension and release, fast and slow,
                    loud and quiet.<br>
                    A film can be fast-paced but have no rhythm (exhausting). A film can be slow-paced but have
                    beautiful rhythm (hypnotic). Pacing is about <em>speed</em>. Rhythm is about <em>variance</em>. The
                    best editors control both independently. Think of breathing: inhale (tension), exhale (release). A
                    film that never exhales suffocates the audience.
                </p>

                <h3>When NOT to Cut</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    The most powerful editorial decision is often <strong>refusing to cut</strong>. When a scene is
                    emotionally charged, holding the shot forces the audience to sit with the discomfort. They can't
                    look away because you haven't given them a new image to escape to. The uncut take says: "You must
                    feel this. There is no relief." Consider the long takes in <em>12 Years a Slave</em> — the camera
                    holds during violence, and the refusal to cut is more disturbing than any montage of horror could
                    be. Every time you reach for the cut key, ask: "Would this moment be stronger if I didn't?"

                <h3>Hold the Shot Meaning</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    "Holding the shot" means letting a take run beyond its expected endpoint. A character delivers a
                    line, and instead of cutting, the camera lingers. The audience begins to read the <em>after</em> —
                    the micro-expression that follows the words, the exhale, the look away. Holding the shot creates
                    space for truth that dialogue cannot reach. It also creates discomfort — and discomfort is
                    engagement. Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Kubrick all understood: the moment after the moment is often
                    where the real film lives.

                <span class="letter">D</span>
                <h2>Montage Theory</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The collision of images creates meaning that doesn't exist in either image alone. This is cinema's unique
                power.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Montage Theory</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Montage has two meanings. In Hollywood, it's the "training sequence" — a rapid series of shots
                    compressing time (Rocky running up steps). But in classical film theory, montage is the fundamental
                    principle that <strong>editing creates meaning</strong>. Juxtaposing any two shots creates a third
                    idea in the audience's mind. This isn't just a technique — it's the basis of cinematic language
                    itself. A shot of a ticking clock followed by a shot of a nervous face creates "deadline" — a
                    meaning that exists in neither shot individually.

                <h3>Eisenstein's Montage</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Sergei Eisenstein formalized montage into five types, each creating meaning differently:<br>
                    <strong>Metric</strong> — Cuts at regular intervals, regardless of content. Creates mechanical
                    rhythm, urgency.<br>
                    <strong>Rhythmic</strong> — Cut timing follows the action's rhythm. March footage cut to the rhythm
                    of marching steps.<br>
                    <strong>Tonal</strong> — Cuts based on emotional tone. Quiet, misty shots cut together to create a
                    mood of melancholy.<br>
                    <strong>Overtonal</strong> — Combines metric, rhythmic, and tonal simultaneously for complex
                    emotional effects.<br>
                    <strong>Intellectual</strong> — Juxtaposing conceptually unrelated images to create abstract ideas.
                    Eisenstein cut between a workers' uprising and the slaughter of a bull in <em>Strike</em> — the
                    audience understands "the workers are being slaughtered" without anyone saying it.

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Invisible Editing</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    The goal of most narrative editing: the audience never notices the cuts. Invisible editing means
                    every transition feels natural, motivated, and seamless. Techniques include: cutting on action (the
                    eye is distracted by movement), cutting during dialogue (the brain focuses on words, not image
                    changes), consistent screen direction, and motivated sound transitions. The mark of a great editor
                    is a film where the audience has no memory of individual cuts — only a continuous emotional
                    experience. If you notice the editing, it's either brilliant or broken.
