            Motion graphics is <strong>design in time</strong>. Everything that applies to static design applies here —
            hierarchy, contrast, balance — but now you're also controlling <em>when</em> things happen and <em>how</em>
            they transform.
            The biggest trap: making things move because you can, not because the motion communicates something.

                <h3>Motion Design Principles</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Motion design is not animation with a brand. It's the discipline of using <strong>movement to
                        communicate information, create emotion, and guide attention</strong>. The core principles:
                    every element should move with purpose, every transition should carry meaning, and every pause
                    should give the viewer time to process. The hierarchy of motion design: clarity first, beauty
                    second, "cool" never. If the viewer doesn't understand what they're looking at within the first
                    second, the design has failed — no matter how smooth the animation.

                <h3>Animation Principles (12 Principles of Animation)</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Created at Disney in the 1930s, these 12 principles remain the foundation of all motion — 2D, 3D,
                    motion graphics, and even AI:<br><br>
                    <strong>1. Squash & Stretch</strong> — Objects deform to show weight and flexibility. A bouncing
                    ball squashes on impact.<br>
                    <strong>2. Anticipation</strong> — Before a big action, a small preparatory movement. A character
                    crouches before jumping.<br>
                    <strong>3. Staging</strong> — Composition and positioning that make the action clear to the
                    audience.<br>
                    <strong>4. Straight Ahead vs Pose to Pose</strong> — Two workflow approaches: drawing frame-by-frame
                    vs key poses first.<br>
                    <strong>5. Follow Through & Overlapping</strong> — Different parts of a body stop at different
                    times. Hair continues after the head stops.<br>
                    <strong>6. Slow In & Slow Out</strong> — Movement accelerates from rest and decelerates to stop.
                    Nothing in nature moves at constant speed.<br>
                    <strong>7. Arcs</strong> — Natural movement follows curved paths, not straight lines.<br>
                    <strong>8. Secondary Action</strong> — Supporting movements that enrich the main action (a character
                    walking while adjusting their hat).<br>
                    <strong>9. Timing</strong> — The number of frames between key poses determines perceived speed and
                    weight.<br>
                    <strong>10. Exaggeration</strong> — Push beyond realism for clarity and impact.<br>
                    <strong>11. Solid Drawing</strong> — Understanding 3D form, weight, and balance in a 2D medium.<br>
                    <strong>12. Appeal</strong> — Characters and movements should be interesting to watch. Even a
                    villain should be visually compelling.

                <h3>Timing and Spacing</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    <strong>Timing</strong> is how many frames an action takes (fast or slow). <strong>Spacing</strong>
                    is the distance between positions in each frame (even or accelerating). Together they control the
                    <em>perceived weight, speed, and emotion</em> of every movement. Fast timing + even spacing =
                    mechanical (robotic). Slow timing + eased spacing = gentle, heavy, or contemplative. Quick timing +
                    tight spacing at start, wide at end = explosion. The same object animated with different timing and
                    spacing can feel like a feather or a bowling ball.

                <h3>Easing Curves</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Easing defines <em>how</em> an object accelerates and decelerates between keyframes. Linear motion
                    (no easing) feels robotic and lifeless — nothing moves at constant speed. <strong>Ease In</strong> —
                    starts slow, accelerates (falling object). <strong>Ease Out</strong> — starts fast, decelerates
                    (landing object). <strong>Ease In-Out</strong> — slow start, fast middle, slow end (most natural
                    motion). <strong>Custom curves</strong> — asymmetric easing for character: a quick snap followed by
                    a gentle settle creates personality. Easing is the difference between motion that feels
                    "computer-generated" and motion that feels alive. Master the graph editor.

                <h3>Anticipation and Follow Through</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    <strong>Anticipation:</strong> Before any major action, there's a small opposite movement. A ball
                    compresses before bouncing. A character pulls their arm back before throwing. A UI element briefly
                    shrinks before expanding. Anticipation tells the viewer "something is about to happen" — it's
                    nature's way of preparing the eye.<br>
                    <strong>Follow Through:</strong> After the main action stops, secondary elements continue briefly.
                    Hair settles after a head stops turning. A menu overshoots its final position and bounces back.
                    Follow through creates the feeling of physical reality — that the object has mass, momentum, and
                    imperfection. Without anticipation and follow through, motion feels dead.

                <span class="letter">B</span>
                <h2>Motion Language</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Motion isn't decoration. It's a language with grammar, vocabulary, and meaning.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Kinetic Typography</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Text that moves with meaning. Kinetic typography treats words as <strong>visual and temporal
                        objects</strong> — their movement, scale, speed, and rhythm all add layers of meaning to the
                    words themselves. The word "CRASH" slamming into frame is different from "crash" floating gently.
                    Kinetic typography transforms reading into experiencing. The principles: the movement should reflect
                    the word's meaning (semantic motion), the rhythm should match the intended reading pace, and the
                    hierarchy should guide the eye through the message. Bad kinetic typography: everything moves all the
                    time. Good kinetic typography: motion punctuates meaning.

                <h3>Visual Rhythm</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Just like music has beats and rests, motion design has visual rhythm — the <strong>pattern of action
                        and stillness</strong> over time. A sequence of elements appearing at regular intervals creates
                    a beat. Breaking that pattern creates emphasis. Three elements enter quickly, the fourth enters
                    slowly — the fourth becomes the star. Visual rhythm creates anticipation: once the audience learns
                    the pattern, they lean in when it breaks. The best motion graphics feel like compositions — they
                    have a tempo, bridges, verses, and a crescendo.

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Motion Hierarchy</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    In static design, hierarchy is achieved through size, color, and position. In motion design,
                    hierarchy adds a temporal dimension: <strong>what moves first is what matters most</strong>. The
                    primary element animates in with the most elaborate motion. Secondary elements follow. Background
                    elements move subtly or remain static. If everything moves simultaneously with equal energy, the
                    viewer's eye doesn't know where to look — you've created visual noise. Motion hierarchy = temporal
                    priority + movement emphasis.

                <h3>Motion Continuity</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Motion continuity means that movements across scenes or compositions <strong>feel connected</strong>
                    — objects leave one scene in a direction and enter the next from the corresponding side. Speed feels
                    consistent. The visual language established in the first shot persists. Without motion continuity,
                    sequences feel disjointed and amateurish. It's the motion graphics equivalent of cinematic
                    continuity editing — the audience should never feel a jarring disconnect between moments.

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Meaningful Transitions</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    A transition is not a decoration between scenes — it's a <strong>statement about the relationship
                        between them</strong>. A dissolve implies connection or transformation. A hard cut implies
                    contrast or collision. A morph transition says "these two things are one." A wipe says "time is
                    passing." Every transition carries narrative information. If a transition exists only because "it
                    looked cool," it's noise. The question: "What does this transition <em>mean</em>?"

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Motion as Emotion</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Different types of motion trigger different emotional responses:<br>
                    <strong>Smooth, slow, flowing</strong> = calm, elegant, peaceful<br>
                    <strong>Quick, sharp, snappy</strong> = energetic, playful, urgent<br>
                    <strong>Jittery, erratic</strong> = anxiety, instability, danger<br>
                    <strong>Elastic, bouncy</strong> = fun, youthful, approachable<br>
                    <strong>Heavy, labored</strong> = serious, weighty, important<br>
                    <strong>Floating, drifting</strong> = dreamlike, detached, ethereal<br>
                    Movement is inherently emotional because our bodies understand physics instinctively. We
                    <em>feel</em> the weight, resistance, and effort of animated objects. This is why easing matters so
                    much — the physics of motion triggers empathic response.

                <h3>Calm vs Aggressive Motion</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    <strong>Calm motion:</strong> Long easing curves, gentle speed changes, wide arcs, soft landing,
                    gradual transitions, low contrast between speeds. Creates a sense of professionalism, luxury, or
                    contemplation. Think Apple product videos — everything moves slowly, intentionally, with
                    precision.<br>
                    <strong>Aggressive motion:</strong> Snap easing (quick acceleration, instant stop), linear segments,
                    overshoot, screen shake, rapid scale changes, hard cuts. Creates energy, impact, urgency. Think
                    sports graphics, action movie titles, and tech product launches.<br>
                    Mixing the two within a single piece creates contrast and drama — a long calm build followed by an
                    aggressive burst is exponentially more impactful than aggression alone.

                <h3>Keyframing Basics</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    A keyframe marks a specific property value at a specific point in time. The software interpolates
                    between keyframes to create motion. Keyframe at frame 0: object at position X=0. Keyframe at frame
                    30: object at position X=500. The software generates all 30 intermediate positions. The magic is in
                    what happens <em>between</em> the keyframes — and that's controlled by easing. The minimum keyframes
                    principle: use the fewest keyframes possible to describe the motion. Fewer keyframes = cleaner, more
                    controllable animation.

                <h3>Graph Editor Explained</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    The graph editor visualizes how a property changes over time as a curve. The X-axis is time. The
                    Y-axis is the property value. A straight line = constant speed. A curved line = acceleration or
                    deceleration. A steep curve = fast change. A flat curve = no change. This is the <strong>most
                        powerful animation tool</strong> and the one most beginners avoid. Working in the graph editor
                    gives you pixel-perfect control over feeling. Two animations can have identical start and end points
                    but feel completely different based on their graph curves.

                <p class="desc">
                    Bézier curves use control handles to create smooth, adjustable curves between keyframes. In
                    animation, they define easing behavior. Pull a handle up and right = slow start, fast end. Pull a
                    handle down and left = fast start, slow end. The handles give you precise control over the
                    <em>character</em> of motion — the difference between a gentle settle and an aggressive snap. In
                    CSS: <code>cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1)</code>. In After Effects: the graph editor handles. The
                    concept is identical everywhere.

                <p class="desc">
                    An alpha channel is the <strong>transparency layer</strong> of an image or video. RGBA: Red, Green,
                    Blue, and Alpha. Alpha = 0 means fully transparent. Alpha = 255 means fully opaque. Alpha channels
                    allow you to composite elements on top of each other — text over video, a character over a
                    background, effects over footage. Without understanding alpha, compositing is impossible. Key
                    insight: when rendering motion graphics elements for compositing, always render with an alpha
                    channel (ProRes 4444, PNG sequence, or WebM VP9).

                <p class="desc">
                    Compositing is the art of <strong>layering multiple visual elements</strong> into a single final
                    image. Foreground over background. Text over footage. VFX elements over live action. Compositing is
                    not just stacking — it's matching. The composited elements must match in lighting, color, noise,
                    motion blur, and perspective to feel like they belong together. Bad compositing: elements look
                    "pasted on." Good compositing: you can't tell what's real and what isn't. Skills needed: matte
                    extraction, color matching, edge refinement, and layer order.

                <p class="desc">
                    Blend modes determine how two layers interact mathematically:<br>
                    <strong>Normal</strong> — Top layer covers bottom. Standard stacking.<br>
                    <strong>Multiply</strong> — Darkens. White disappears, black stays. Great for shadows and overlaying
                    textures onto footage.<br>
                    <strong>Screen</strong> — Lightens. Black disappears, white stays. Perfect for fire, light leaks,
                    and glows over dark footage.<br>
                    <strong>Overlay</strong> — Combines Multiply and Screen. Increases contrast. Used for texture
                    integration and color grading effects.<br>

                    Understanding blend modes means understanding how color values interact mathematically. This
                    knowledge transfers across every tool: Photoshop, After Effects, Blender, CSS (mix-blend-mode), and
                    even AI compositing workflows.

                <h3>Masking Animation</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    A mask defines which part of a layer is visible. Animating the mask — its shape, position, or
                    feather — over time creates reveals, wipes, and selective visibility. A text element revealed by a
                    traveling mask feels deliberate and polished. A circular mask expanding from center creates a
                    spotlight reveal. Masks can track motion, follow shapes, and create complex animated mattes. Masking
                    is the bridge between static design and temporal design — it answers the question: "What does the
                    viewer see <em>now</em>, and what is hidden for later?"

                <h3>Parallax Motion</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Parallax is the principle that <strong>objects at different distances move at different
                        speeds</strong> relative to the viewer. Close objects move fast, distant objects move slow. This
                    creates the illusion of 3D depth in a 2D composition. In motion design: separating a scene into
                    foreground, midground, and background layers and moving them at different speeds during a camera pan
                    creates rich, dimensional space. Used everywhere — title sequences, social media posts, explainer
                    videos, and web design scroll effects. The depth is an illusion, but the brain reads it as real.
