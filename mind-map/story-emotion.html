            This is the layer that separates work that <em>looks</em> good from work that <strong>makes you feel
                something</strong>.
            Every technique in filmmaking, motion graphics, and AI generation is ultimately in service of emotion.
            If you skip emotional architecture, your work will always feel hollow — no matter how polished.
        </p>

        <div class="warning-block">
            <strong>⚠️ Why people fail:</strong> They learn camera, lighting, editing, and color — then wonder why
            their film feels empty. The answer is always the same: they never learned how to construct emotional truth.
            Technique without emotion is decoration.

                <h2>Emotional Architecture</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The structural engineering of feeling. How stories create, sustain, and release emotional pressure.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Emotional Arc</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    An emotional arc is the <strong>trajectory of feeling</strong> across a story — for the character
                    and, more importantly, for the audience. It's not a plot arc (what happens) but a feeling arc (how
                    it feels). A great emotional arc moves through distinct phases: comfort → disruption → struggle →
                    transformation → resolution. But the key insight is that the arc must have <strong>variance</strong>
                    — ups and downs, tension and release. A story that stays at one emotional intensity is monotone. Joy
                    needs to follow despair for either to land. The audience needs to breathe between emotional peaks —
                    otherwise they go numb.
                </p>
                <p class="desc" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <strong>Practical application:</strong> Before you edit, write down the emotional arc of your piece
                    in one sentence: "The audience should go from curious → anxious → devastated → quietly hopeful."
                    This sentence becomes your editing compass — every cut, hold, music choice, and pacing decision
                    serves this trajectory.

                <h3>Internal Conflict Visualized</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    The hardest challenge in visual storytelling: how do you show what a character feels <em>inside</em>
                    without dialogue? Internal conflict must be <strong>externalized through behavior, environment, and
                        visual metaphor</strong>. A character struggling with guilt might obsessively clean (external
                    behavior reflecting internal state). A room that progressively darkens as a conversation turns
                    difficult (environment as emotion). A mirror that shows a different expression than the character's
                    face (the self divided). The tools: body language, spatial positioning, lighting shifts, weather,
                    objects, and most powerfully — the held close-up where the audience reads micro-expressions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Show Don't Tell (Advanced Examples)</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Everyone knows "show don't tell" — but most people understand it superficially. The advanced version
                    isn't just "show actions instead of stating feelings." It's about <strong>trusting the audience to
                        decode meaning without direct statement</strong>. Advanced examples:<br><br>
                    <strong>❌ Basic:</strong> A character says "I'm lonely."<br>
                    <strong>✅ Intermediate:</strong> A character eats dinner alone. (Visual but obvious.)<br>
                    <strong>✅✅ Advanced:</strong> A character sets two plates on a table, pauses, then silently puts one
                    back. (The absence tells the story. The action of setting two plates reveals habit — they're used to
                    company. Putting one back reveals loss. The silence lets the audience fill in the grief.)<br><br>
                    The most powerful version of "show don't tell" is <strong>show then withhold</strong> — give the
                    audience just enough information to construct the emotion themselves. What they imagine is always
                    more powerful than what you show them.

        <!-- B. PRESSURE & TENSION -->
        <div class="subgroup">

                <span class="letter">B</span>
                <h2>Pressure & Tension</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Every great scene has a force pressing down. Learn the types of pressure and you'll know how to create
                tension anywhere.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Time Pressure in Scenes</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Time pressure is the simplest and most effective form of dramatic tension: <strong>something must
                        happen before a deadline</strong>. The bomb is ticking. The sun is setting. The bus is leaving.
                    The exam starts in five minutes. Time pressure works because the audience's brain automatically
                    starts a countdown. Every moment that passes without resolution increases anxiety. Hitchcock called
                    the bomb under the table the purest form of suspense — the audience knows it's there, the characters
                    don't, and the clock is ticking. In editing, you create time pressure through cross-cutting
                    (parallel action), increasing cut speed, removing pauses, and using rhythmic sound design.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Spatial Pressure in Scenes</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    Space itself can create emotional pressure. <strong>Confined spaces</strong> (closets, elevators,
                    interrogation rooms, submarines) create claustrophobia and force character confrontation — there's
                    literally no escape. <strong>Vast empty spaces</strong> (deserts, empty fields, abandoned buildings)
                    create existential dread — there's nowhere to hide. <strong>Shrinking spaces</strong> — where the
                    environment progressively closes in — create escalating panic. The walls are closing in, literally
                    or figuratively. Spatial pressure is achieved through framing (tighter shots = more pressure),
                    production design (smaller rooms), lens choice (wide lenses distort and exaggerate proximity), and
                    blocking (characters physically closer than comfortable).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Presence vs Absence in Film</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    One of cinema's most powerful but least understood tools: the emotional weight of what is
                    <strong>not there</strong>. An empty chair at a dinner table. A room full of someone's belongings
                    but no one home. A photo frame turned face-down. Absence makes the audience do the emotional work —
                    they imagine who should be there, why they're gone, what happened. This is more powerful than
                    showing the event itself because the audience's imagination personalizes the grief. In horror: the
                    monster you never see is scarier than the one you do. In drama: the conversation that never happens
                    is more devastating than the fight that does.

        <!-- C. VISUAL METAPHOR -->

                <span class="letter">C</span>
                <h2>Visual Metaphor & Symbolism</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The poetic layer of visual storytelling. Where images say what words cannot.</p>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Visual Metaphor (Non-Literal)</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    A visual metaphor uses an image to represent something beyond its literal meaning. It's not about
                    being "deep" — it's about <strong>efficient emotional communication</strong>. A cage doesn't always
                    mean a cage — it might represent a marriage, a routine, a belief system. Rain doesn't always mean
                    rain — it might represent grief, cleansing, or renewal. The key is that the metaphor must feel
                    <em>organic</em>, not imposed. If you have to explain it, it failed. If the audience feels it before
                    they can articulate it, it worked.<br><br>
                    <strong>Examples:</strong> In <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, rain during Andy's escape = freedom
                    and purification. In <em>Parasite</em>, the stairs represent social hierarchy. In <em>Blade Runner
                        2049</em>, the barren landscapes reflect the protagonist's emotional emptiness. The metaphor
                    doesn't announce itself — it accumulates meaning through repetition and context.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="skill">
                <h3>Symbolism vs Obvious Imagery</h3>
                <p class="desc">
                    <strong>Symbolism</strong> is subtle — it reveals itself over time and rewards careful viewing. A
                    recurring color, object, or composition that gains meaning through repetition and context. The
                    audience <em>discovers</em> it.<br>
                    <strong>Obvious imagery</strong> is blunt — a character walking through a door labeled "NEW LIFE" or
                    a dove flying away to represent "freedom." The audience doesn't discover; they're told.<br><br>
                    The difference: symbolism trusts the audience. Obvious imagery talks down to them. The goal is
                    imagery where the meaning is available to those paying attention but doesn't interrupt the narrative
                    for those who aren't. A candle that burns lower as an argument intensifies (subtle). A character
                    literally drowning to represent "feeling overwhelmed" (obvious). Symbolism is a whisper. Obvious
                    imagery is a sign on the wall.
