            <p class="intro">Motion graphics is <strong>design in time</strong>. Everything that applies to static
                design applies here — hierarchy, contrast, balance — but now you're also controlling <em>when</em>
                things happen and <em>how</em> they transform. The biggest trap: making things move because you can, not
                because the motion communicates something.</p>

            <div class="sh"><span class="sl a">A</span>
                <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="st">The non-negotiable principles. These apply to everything from title sequences to 3-second
                Instagram animations.</p>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Motion Design Principles</h3>
                <p>Motion design is not animation with a brand. It's the discipline of using <strong>movement to
                        communicate information, create emotion, and guide attention</strong>. Every element should move
                    with purpose, every transition should carry meaning, and every pause should give the viewer time to
                    process. The hierarchy: clarity first, beauty second, "cool" never. If the viewer doesn't understand
                    what they're looking at within the first second, the design has failed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Animation Principles (12 Principles of Animation)</h3>
                <p>Created at Disney in the 1930s, these remain the foundation of all motion:<br><br><strong>1. Squash &
                        Stretch</strong> — Objects deform to show weight and flexibility.<br><strong>2.
                        Anticipation</strong> — A small preparatory movement before a big action.<br><strong>3.
                        Staging</strong> — Composition that makes the action clear.<br><strong>4. Straight Ahead vs Pose
                        to Pose</strong> — Two workflow approaches: frame-by-frame vs key poses first.<br><strong>5.
                        Follow Through & Overlapping</strong> — Different parts stop at different times.<br><strong>6.
                        Slow In & Slow Out</strong> — Movement accelerates from rest and decelerates to
                    stop.<br><strong>7. Arcs</strong> — Natural movement follows curved paths.<br><strong>8. Secondary
                        Action</strong> — Supporting movements that enrich the main action.<br><strong>9.
                        Timing</strong> — Frames between key poses determines perceived speed and weight.<br><strong>10.
                        Exaggeration</strong> — Push beyond realism for clarity and impact.<br><strong>11. Solid
                        Drawing</strong> — Understanding 3D form, weight, and balance.<br><strong>12. Appeal</strong> —
                    Characters and movements should be interesting to watch.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Timing and Spacing</h3>
                <p><strong>Timing</strong> is how many frames an action takes. <strong>Spacing</strong> is the distance
                    between positions in each frame. Together they control the <em>perceived weight, speed, and
                        emotion</em> of every movement. Fast timing + even spacing = mechanical. Slow timing + eased
                    spacing = gentle, heavy, or contemplative. The same object animated with different timing and
                    spacing can feel like a feather or a bowling ball.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Easing Curves</h3>
                <p>Easing defines <em>how</em> an object accelerates and decelerates between keyframes. Linear motion
                    (no easing) feels robotic. <strong>Ease In</strong> — starts slow, accelerates (falling object).
                    <strong>Ease Out</strong> — starts fast, decelerates (landing). <strong>Ease In-Out</strong> — slow
                    start, fast middle, slow end (most natural). <strong>Custom curves</strong> — a quick snap followed
                    by a gentle settle creates personality. Easing is the difference between motion that feels
                    "computer-generated" and motion that feels alive. Master the graph editor.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Anticipation and Follow Through</h3>
                <p><strong>Anticipation:</strong> Before any major action, a small opposite movement. A ball compresses
                    before bouncing. A UI element briefly shrinks before expanding. It tells the viewer "something is
                    about to happen."<br><strong>Follow Through:</strong> After the main action stops, secondary
                    elements continue briefly. Hair settles after a head stops turning. A menu overshoots its final
                    position and bounces back. Without anticipation and follow through, motion feels dead.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- B. MOTION LANGUAGE -->
        <div class="sec">
            <div class="sh"><span class="sl b">B</span>
                <h2>Motion Language</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="st">Motion isn't decoration. It's a language with grammar, vocabulary, and meaning.</p>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Kinetic Typography</h3>
                <p>Text that moves with meaning. Kinetic typography treats words as <strong>visual and temporal
                        objects</strong> — their movement, scale, speed, and rhythm all add layers of meaning. The word
                    "CRASH" slamming into frame is different from "crash" floating gently. The movement should reflect
                    the word's meaning (semantic motion), the rhythm should match the intended reading pace, and the
                    hierarchy should guide the eye through the message. Bad kinetic typography: everything moves all the
                    time. Good: motion punctuates meaning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Visual Rhythm</h3>
                <p>Just like music has beats and rests, motion design has visual rhythm — the <strong>pattern of action
                        and stillness</strong> over time. A sequence of elements appearing at regular intervals creates
                    a beat. Breaking that pattern creates emphasis. Three elements enter quickly, the fourth enters
                    slowly — the fourth becomes the star. The best motion graphics feel like compositions — they have a
                    tempo, bridges, verses, and a crescendo.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Motion Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>In motion design, hierarchy adds a temporal dimension: <strong>what moves first is what matters
                        most</strong>. The primary element animates in with the most elaborate motion. Secondary
                    elements follow. Background elements move subtly or remain static. If everything moves
                    simultaneously with equal energy, the viewer's eye doesn't know where to look — you've created
                    visual noise. Motion hierarchy = temporal priority + movement emphasis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Motion Continuity</h3>
                <p>Motion continuity means movements across scenes <strong>feel connected</strong> — objects leave one
                    scene in a direction and enter the next from the corresponding side. Speed feels consistent. The
                    visual language established in the first shot persists. Without it, sequences feel disjointed and
                    amateurish. It's the motion graphics equivalent of cinematic continuity editing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Meaningful Transitions</h3>
                <p>A transition is not decoration — it's a <strong>statement about the relationship between
                        scenes</strong>. A dissolve implies connection or transformation. A hard cut implies contrast. A
                    morph says "these two things are one." A wipe says "time is passing." Every transition carries
                    narrative information. If a transition exists only because "it looked cool," it's noise. The
                    question: "What does this transition <em>mean</em>?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Motion as Emotion</h3>
                <p>Different types of motion trigger different emotional responses:<br><strong>Smooth, slow,
                        flowing</strong> = calm, elegant, peaceful<br><strong>Quick, sharp, snappy</strong> = energetic,
                    playful, urgent<br><strong>Jittery, erratic</strong> = anxiety, instability,
                    danger<br><strong>Elastic, bouncy</strong> = fun, youthful, approachable<br><strong>Heavy,
                        labored</strong> = serious, weighty, important<br><strong>Floating, drifting</strong> =
                    dreamlike, detached, ethereal<br>We <em>feel</em> the weight, resistance, and effort of animated
                    objects. This is why easing matters — the physics of motion triggers empathic response.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Calm vs Aggressive Motion</h3>
                <p><strong>Calm motion:</strong> Long easing curves, gentle speed changes, wide arcs, soft landing.
                    Creates professionalism, luxury, or contemplation. Think Apple product videos — everything moves
                    slowly, intentionally, with precision.<br><strong>Aggressive motion:</strong> Snap easing, linear
                    segments, overshoot, screen shake, rapid scale changes, hard cuts. Creates energy, impact, urgency.
                    Think sports graphics, action movie titles.<br>Mixing the two creates contrast and drama — a long
                    calm build followed by an aggressive burst is exponentially more impactful than aggression alone.

            <p class="st">These concepts apply everywhere — After Effects, Blender, CSS, Remotion, AI generators. The
                principles don't change with the tool.</p>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Keyframing Basics</h3>
                <p>A keyframe marks a specific property value at a specific point in time. The software interpolates
                    between keyframes to create motion. The magic is in what happens <em>between</em> the keyframes —
                    and that's controlled by easing. The minimum keyframes principle: use the fewest keyframes possible
                    to describe the motion. Fewer keyframes = cleaner, more controllable animation.</p>

                <h3>Graph Editor Explained</h3>
                <p>The graph editor visualizes how a property changes over time as a curve. X-axis is time. Y-axis is
                    property value. A straight line = constant speed. A curved line = acceleration or deceleration. This
                    is the <strong>most powerful animation tool</strong> and the one most beginners avoid. Two
                    animations can have identical start and end points but feel completely different based on their
                    graph curves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Bézier Curves Animation</h3>
                <p>Bézier curves use control handles to create smooth, adjustable curves between keyframes. They define
                    easing behavior. The handles give you precise control over the <em>character</em> of motion — the
                    difference between a gentle settle and an aggressive snap. In CSS:
                    <code>cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1)</code>. In After Effects: the graph editor handles. The concept
                    is identical everywhere.</p>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Alpha Channels</h3>
                <p>An alpha channel is the <strong>transparency layer</strong> of an image or video. RGBA: Red, Green,
                    Blue, and Alpha. Alpha = 0 means fully transparent. Alpha = 255 means fully opaque. Alpha channels
                    allow you to composite elements on top of each other. When rendering motion graphics for
                    compositing, always render with an alpha channel (ProRes 4444, PNG sequence, or WebM VP9).</p>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Compositing Basics</h3>
                <p>Compositing is the art of <strong>layering multiple visual elements</strong> into a single final
                    image. Composited elements must match in lighting, color, noise, motion blur, and perspective to
                    feel like they belong together. Bad compositing: elements look "pasted on." Good compositing: you
                    can't tell what's real and what isn't. Skills needed: matte extraction, color matching, edge
                    refinement, and layer order.</p>

                <h3>Blend Modes Explained</h3>
                <p><strong>Normal</strong> — Top layer covers bottom. Standard stacking.<br><strong>Multiply</strong> —
                    Darkens. White disappears, black stays. Great for shadows and textures.<br><strong>Screen</strong> —
                    Lightens. Black disappears, white stays. Perfect for fire, light leaks, and
                    glows.<br><strong>Overlay</strong> — Combines Multiply and Screen. Increases contrast. Used for
                    texture integration.<br><strong>Add</strong> — Adds brightness values. Creates extreme glows and
                    light effects.<br>This knowledge transfers across every tool: Photoshop, After Effects, Blender, CSS
                    (mix-blend-mode), and AI compositing workflows.</p>

                <h3>Masking Animation</h3>
                <p>A mask defines which part of a layer is visible. Animating the mask over time creates reveals, wipes,
                    and selective visibility. A text element revealed by a traveling mask feels deliberate and polished.
                    Masking is the bridge between static design and temporal design — it answers: "What does the viewer
                    see <em>now</em>, and what is hidden for later?"</p>

            <div class="sk">
                <h3>Parallax Motion</h3>
                <p>Parallax is the principle that <strong>objects at different distances move at different
                        speeds</strong> relative to the viewer. Close objects move fast, distant objects move slow. This
                    creates the illusion of 3D depth in a 2D composition. Separating a scene into foreground, midground,
                    and background layers and moving them at different speeds creates rich, dimensional space. Used
                    everywhere — title sequences, social media, explainer videos, and web scroll effects.</p>
